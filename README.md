# Magic-8-Ball
The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an eight-ball used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. 
It was developed in the 1950s by Mattel. The principle is quite easy. The user asks a yes-or-no question to the Magic 8 Ball which is a large plastic ball. 
Then, the user turns the Magic 8 Ball over to reveal a written answer which appears on the surface. 
The magic ball can answer some of the following lines:  
It is certain, It is decidedly so, Without a doubt, Yes â€“ definitely, You may rely on it, As I see it, yes, Most Likely, Outlook good, Yes, and Signs point to yes. 
These are the affirmative answers.

Working:
We display a message to the user explaining how to play the Magic 8 Ball. 
The next step is to define an input letting the user enter a question to ask the Magic 8 Ball.
We will use a simple answers array: 
We installed a click listener on the eight-ball div. 
So, when the user clicks on the Magic 8 Ball our function will be called. 
In that function, we check if a question has been entered. 
If not, we display an alert to the user indicating that he must enter a question.
